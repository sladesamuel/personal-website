# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built using Gatsby React and Tailwind CSS to give a better developer experience, while producing static web files for high performance when hosted.

The website is automatically built and deployed to Netlify. You can view it at https://samuelslade.netlify.app/

## Prerequisites

If you wish to build and run this project locally, you will need to install the following tools:

1. [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

## Getting started

In order to build and run the project locally, execute the following commands from the terminal in the root folder.

```shell
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

You can then view the website in the browser at the URL http://localhost:8000
